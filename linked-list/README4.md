# Challenge Summary
Write a function called zip lists that takes 2 arguments: 2 linked lists and returns: New Linked List, zipped. where it zips the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

## Whiteboard Process
!['zip'](../images/ll-zipLists.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O space is O(1) because based on that the memory consumption of my algorithm remains constant because I just modify the existing nodes without creating any new nodes
and Big O for time complexity is O(n) because we will have to traverse through the entire linked list to merge them together

## Solution
npm test to run the code
